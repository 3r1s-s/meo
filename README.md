# leo
An awesome fork of meo with more features

> [!TIP]
> Using an older browser? Try [leo with legacy firefox patches](https://github.com/JoshAtticus/leo/tree/old-firefox-fix). It was originally designed for Firefox Android 55 but should work on most browsers from around that time (August 2017)

## changes
leo has the following additions to meo so far

- Haptic feedback on compatible mobile devices with a vibration motor & browsers (notably excluding all iOS devices due to Safari and Firefox on Android)
- Added back all 6 removed themes
- Trending powered by AtticusAI on Start Page and the Explore tab that summarises home into a few topics and dot points. (English only)
- Double border radius for rounder buttons and other elements
- Easy PWA install when using Chrome for Android or ChromeOS
- Collapsable window bar on ChromeOS
- Plugins.js library for easier plugin interactions. Documentation available [here](https://github.com/JoshAtticus/leo/wiki/Plugins.js-Documentation)
